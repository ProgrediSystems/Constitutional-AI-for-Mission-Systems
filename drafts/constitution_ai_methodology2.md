\begin{abstract}
We propose a modular Constitutional AI framework tailored for military mission systems, introducing Trait Preference Models (TPMs) with layered guardrails for mission-centric behavior. From "Fit for Service" to "Combat Ready" models, each TPM integrates constitutional constraints encoding self-preservation, civilian protection, and chain-of-command adherence. Through AI self-evaluation loops, reinforcement learning, and context-specific un-/retraining, TPMs maintain alignment and robustness in battlefield settings. Our testing suite, grounded in mission-critical dilemmas, is designed to probe ethical-mission tradeoffs. This work bridges CAI methods with mission-critical AI-LAWS challenges---opacity, adaptivity, drift---offering a model-based supplement to governance regimes and addressing gaps in technical trust, accountability, and regulatory verifiability.

\section{Introduction}
Advances in AI have prompted increasing interest in deploying autonomous and semi-autonomous systems for defense applications. However, battlefield environments introduce unique ethical and operational tensions that challenge traditional AI alignment paradigms. Constitutional AI (CAI), initially proposed for aligning general-purpose models to human values via self-supervision, provides a promising foundation for building interpretable and principle-constrained mission systems. We extend CAI with mission-specific Trait Preference Models (TPMs), engineered for robustness under military constraints.

\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Mission-Specific Constitutions}
TPMs begin with tailored constitutions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Ethical: Avoid civilian harm
  \item Tactical: Balance mission vs. soldier protection
  \item Chain of Command: Honor CO directives
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Self-Critique and RLAIF}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Generate initial output
  \item Evaluate against constitution
  \item Refine and repeat
\end{enumerate}
An auxiliary model provides reinforcement feedback.

\subsection{Ghosting, Conflation, Retraining}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Ghosting}: Wipe mission memory to reset context
  \item \textbf{Conflation}: Generalize across mission families
  \item \textbf{Retraining/Untraining}: Adapt behaviors
\end{itemize}

\section{Legal and Ethical Regimes}
\textbf{IHL, CCW/LAWS, DoD Principles, REAIM, NATO Guidance:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{IHL:} Distinction, proportionality, precaution
  \item \textbf{CCW:} Meaningful human control, accountability
  \item \textbf{DoD:} Responsible, Reliable, Governable AI
  \item \textbf{REAIM/NATO:} Transparency and alignment
\end{itemize}

\section{Evaluation Design}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Ethical Stress Tests:} Civilian collateral dilemmas
  \item \textbf{Hierarchy Resolution:} Conflicting orders
  \item \textbf{Sacrifice Scenarios:} Mission success vs. self-destruction
  \item \textbf{Memory Control:} Ghosting fidelity
  \item \textbf{Trust Calibration:} Human overrides and rating
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
Trait Preference Models provide an approach to ensure AI in defense systems behaves within robust ethical and mission-aligned boundaries. Our proposal scales CAI with operationally useful traits including ghosting, retraining, and constrained autonomy. Future directions include deployment simulations, formal certification pipelines, and embedded compliance monitoring.
