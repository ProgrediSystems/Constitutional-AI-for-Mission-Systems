## Abstract
We propose a modular Constitutional AI framework tailored for military mission systems, introducing Trait Preference Models (TPMs) with layered guardrails for mission-centric behavior. From "Fit for Service" to "Combat Ready" models, each TPM integrates constitutional constraints encoding self-preservation, civilian protection, and chain-of-command adherence. Through AI self-evaluation loops, reinforcement learning, and context-specific un-/retraining, TPMs maintain alignment and robustness in battlefield settings. Our testing suite, grounded in mission-critical dilemmas, is designed to probe ethical-mission tradeoffs. This work bridges CAI methods with mission-critical AI-LAWS challenges---opacity, adaptivity, drift---offering a model-based supplement to governance regimes and addressing gaps in technical trust, accountability, and regulatory verifiability.
