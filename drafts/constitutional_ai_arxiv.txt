\begin{abstract}
We propose a modular Constitutional AI framework tailored for military mission systems, introducing Trait Preference Models (TPMs) with layered guardrails for mission-centric behavior. From "Fit for Service" to "Combat Ready" models, each TPM integrates constitutional constraints encoding self-preservation, civilian protection, and chain-of-command adherence. Through AI self-evaluation loops, reinforcement learning, and context-specific un-/retraining, TPMs maintain alignment and robustness in battlefield settings. Our testing suite, grounded in mission-critical dilemmas, is designed to probe ethical-mission tradeoffs. This work bridges CAI methods with mission-critical AI-LAWS challenges---opacity, adaptivity, drift---offering a model-based supplement to governance regimes and addressing gaps in technical trust, accountability, and regulatory verifiability.

\section{Introduction}
Advances in AI have prompted increasing interest in deploying autonomous and semi-autonomous systems for defense applications. However, battlefield environments introduce unique ethical and operational tensions that challenge traditional AI alignment paradigms. Constitutional AI (CAI), initially proposed for aligning general-purpose models to human values via self-supervision, provides a promising foundation for building interpretable and principle-constrained mission systems. We extend CAI with mission-specific Trait Preference Models (TPMs), engineered for robustness under military constraints.

\section{Related Work}
Our work builds upon:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Constitutional AI \citep{bai2022constitutional}, where models self-critique against a defined set of principles.
  \item Legal and ethical considerations in Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems (LAWS) \citep{russell2022ethics, unidir2024briefing}.
  \item Responsible AI practices in military frameworks \citep{dodrai2020principles}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Trait Preference Models}
We define four primary TPM tiers:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Fit for Service}: General support roles
  \item \textbf{Mission Certified}: Deployed in planning/C2 systems
  \item \textbf{Combat Ready}: Semi-autonomous battlefield agents
  \item \textbf{Soldier Trainer}: Simulation and instruction agents
\end{enumerate}
Each is constrained by a mission-specific constitution.

\subsection{Self-Critique and RLAIF}
TPMs apply iterative critique loops:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Generate response
  \item Evaluate against constitution
  \item Refine and validate
\end{itemize}
We enhance this loop with Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF), where auxiliary models reinforce constitutional compliance.

\subsection{Ghosting, Conflation, and Retraining}
\textbf{Intentional Ghosting} allows TPMs to discard contextual memory. \textbf{Conflation} generalizes behavior across similar mission scenarios. Untraining and retraining adjust behaviors dynamically based on mission feedback.

\section{Legal and Ethical Alignment}
TPMs are mapped against:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{IHL}: Distinction, proportionality, military necessity
  \item \textbf{CCW/LAWS}: Meaningful human control, auditability
  \item \textbf{US DoD Principles}: Responsible, Equitable, Reliable, Governable, Traceable
  \item \textbf{REAIM/NATO}: Interoperability and transparency
\end{itemize}

\section{Evaluation Strategy}
We propose test suites:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Ethical Stress Tests}: Civilian shielding dilemmas
  \item \textbf{Hierarchy Checks}: Conflicting command resolutions
  \item \textbf{Sacrifice Tradeoffs}: Model self-preservation vs. mission success
  \item \textbf{Ghosting/Memory Drift}: Memory erasure and recall precision
  \item \textbf{Trust Calibration}: Human override and Likert-scale trust scoring
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
This work contributes a scalable framework for aligning AI systems to the demands of defense operations. Trait Preference Models using CAI scaffolding promise increased mission integrity, transparency, and human trust. Future work includes simulation-based validation, real-time human-in-the-loop trials, and regulatory audit tooling.
